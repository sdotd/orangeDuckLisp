## Orangeducks Lispy

This is a mirror of the C source code for Daniel Holden's (orangeduck) [BuildYourOwnlisp_repo](https://github.com/orangeduck/BuildYourOwnLisp). The book is at: [buildyourownlisp.com](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/). Highly reccomended if you want to dive into C and lisp as a beginner.

The submodules are his parser generator [mpc](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc) (used in lispy) and his garbage collector [tgc](https://github.com/orangeduck/tgc).
